# PixelKillerV2

My friend does photography in his spare time and encountered the problem of hot pixesl with his camera. Essentially his camera has pixels that just show red or green or blue so tiny spots in his images are randomly red green or blue. I thought I could fix this problem so I did. There's a great python Library that basically takes care of this you (I have linked it below) and it worked great. I thought this was a great opportunity to try and make a desktop application as a desktop app's main advantage is access to a file system with no wifi required. That is what I am doing in this repo. Integrating python library into desktop app with some other minor changes.

I AM NOT FINISHED THIS YET. Feel free to check in on my progress tho.
